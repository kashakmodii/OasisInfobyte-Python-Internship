## 📌 Task 1: Voice Assistant

### ✅ Objective

The goal of this task is to build a **basic voice assistant** using Python that can:

- Recognize the command using speech recognition
- Perform simple actions like:
  - Telling the current time/date
  - Opening websites (e.g., Google, YouTube)
  - Responding with speech output
